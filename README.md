# Homework-Week2 This repository contains my submission for the Week 2 challenge. There are three screenshots of the results for running the code on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 data.
They are named Screenshot 2018, Screeshot 2019, and Screenshot2020 respectively. 
The code developed is attached in a vs file named Wall Street-SB.
